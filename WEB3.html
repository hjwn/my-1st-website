    <h2>JavaScript?</h2>
    A <strong><a href="https://ko.javascript.info/manuals-specifications" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a></strong> is a software component that executes JavaScript code. 
    The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern 
    engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.
    JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, 
    and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs 
    in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model 
    nd Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.
    Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, 
    ECMAScript engine is another name for these implementations. 
    With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code 
    in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.
